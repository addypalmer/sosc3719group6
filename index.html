					<h1>Tour Stop 1: Toronto's La Salle Theatre</h1>
					<p>
						La Salle Theatre in Kensington had 650 seats and was located at 526-528 Dundas St West. this building has seen lots of change since the day that it opened many years ago. In 1938, the theatre was renovated and officially opened as La Salle theatre, a place locals went to on Friday nights with their friends and family to watch movies. After many years, the demographic of the area changed and in the 1960s La Salle became Pagoda and screened Chinese films only for another decade until the early 1970s when the theatre shut down again.
						<br><br>
	 					More recently, it was converted into a tiny shopping mall catering to the Canadian Vietnamese community in the area.The building still stands and is almost unrecognizable as a theatre anymore as it’s now been completely abandoned since it’s closure in 2012. This building served the changing community in more ways than for many years and is an important art deco piece in the area.

					<h1>Tour Stop 2: Dr. Comics</h1>
					<p>
						When remembering my time spent working in Dr. Comics, it appears to me like a fever dream. Working in such a space was a childhood aspiration akin to becoming a boxer or hockey player. reading comics and being paid to do so? Yes, please. I listened to Joey Bada$$ and Nas' Illmatic incessantly, certainly annoying the regulars.
						<br><br>
						Aside from choice of music and unlimited comic consumption, the intimate knowledge gained of the market through conversation and observation outweighed any of the mentioned allowances.
						<br><br>
						For example, despite the fact that my class status saying otherwise, I was part of the gentry. Working for an individual named Carmine, I found through conversation that Dr. Comics was not politicized or supportive of the demographics that Kensington has historically housed. Carmine was always calling situations he didn't like "gay," obviously unaware or unsupportive of queers who find refuge in communities such as Kensington. Further, he would constantly speak of the "crack heads," instructing me to kick anyone "like that" out. What does that even mean? Are they identified by rips in their clothing? An unpleasant smell? All of a sudden, I was an arbiter of spatial exclusion - an uneducated stoner who has no concept of spatial justice. That's not my place, nor should it be anyone else's.
						<br><br>
						I was unceremoniously fired due to me calling in sick once throughout my 9 month tenure, however the lived experience observed from a diverse set f people, whether it was through the littany of customers I served, or through my going to each of Kensington's famed restaurant's, speaking with the owners almost as equals - disciples of the Market. This is a set of experiences that I did not have when living in the market in years previous, as I could not afford the features of Kensington due to my apartments high rental price. However, seeing Kensington through a participatory lens was an experience that I will carry with me for my life, despite the bitter separation experienced.
						<br><br>
						When I had visited Kensington for the first time since I was let go, I immediately had gone to see if the shop was still there. It was the summer of 2016, the store had vanished. In its place, a two floor illegal cannabis dispensary. The connections gone; the memory no longer material. It made me think of those who experience this feeling on a much larger scale as an owner of a business that has been displaced. It made me think of what was in the space before Dr. Comics. It brought a feeling of guilt; participating in Kensington's everyday functionality, however unaware that I was part of the problem - a cog in the machine of gentrification. Despite this, Kensington remains politicized and resistant to corporatized gentrification as we have seen through the Market's rejection of stores like Nike and Walmart. Still, the petite gentry can cause significant harm to a neighbourhoods socioeconomic position, Because of this petite gentry's potential for future harm and displacement, we believe our map, "The Fortress of Kensington" is necessitated in order to document the change and maintenance that is being engendered on Kensington through the neoliberal condition of the market's surround area.

					<h1>Tour Stop 3: Graffiti's Bar and Grill</h1>
					<p>
						Graffiti’s Bar and Grill opened its doors in 1995 as a space where local bands and musicians could perform. It was the home of the “black metal brunch” with live music shows and Saturday matinees. A music studio behind the bar called Kensington Sound also provided an influx of artists who performed. Graffiti’s had a perfect vibe that fit into Kensington’s unique atmosphere. It was a small place that provided intimacy during shows that couldn’t be found anywhere else. The owner Stephen Mitchel made sure to hire only local employees of the area to keep the bar feeling like it belongs in Kensington. 
						<br><br>
						After 22 years, Stephen Mitchen decided to sell the place in 2017 but only to an owner that was “good for Kensington”. Eventually in February 2018, Graffiti’s Bar and Grill closed permanently when Ron Hawkins, a local Kensginton artist, played the last show. The new owner of the now Koi Koi Saké Bar is still a Kensington local.

					<h1>Tour Stop 4: Max & Son Butcher Shop</h1>
					<p>
						Max and Son was the local butcher shop, located on the block closest to college street on Augusta Avenue. The shop ran for 54 years straight and was then later bought by Peter Managuan in 2001.
						<br><br>
						Father Max and his son, Solly had worked together in the butcher shop - holding on their family story through ownership. The butcher shop was opened by Max, an immigrant coming from Siberia to Canada in 1949. While the building where the shop was located was constructed in 1930, Max had opened the shop in 1955, and the shop became a fixture of the neighbourhood in the process.
						<br><br>
 						“Max and Son” was one of the last of the Jewish businesses to survive from the earlier days of Kensington, when it was primarily a Jewish market. Max Stern’s son, Saul (Solly) came to work in his father’s meat market in the 1950s, after he graduated from high school at 16 years of age. He spent his entire working life in the store, retiring from the shop in 2009.
 						<br><br>
						In a post found on the now-owner’s Website, Sanagan’s, it is revealed how the building came to be sold. At the end of the 2009 summer, Peter was walking through Kensington and saw a “For Sale” sign on the historic butcher shop. When he went in, he found Solly who apparently “needed a break”, which Peter then capitalized on. The butcher shop was sold to Peter and he is running his own butcher shop called “Sanagan's Meat Locker”, which has become a success in it’s own right - recently expanding to the east end. Despite the fact that the shutting of this business is indicative of a generation of business owners being forced into obsolescence by their age, the historicization of the original Max and Son that Peter has done through his own volition is symbolic of business owners appreciating the legacy of culture and business that the contemporary market has been built upon. In fact, his documentation of the store through interviews with news outlets was the largest source of information that we could find on the store, keeping the Market’s legacy alive.

					<h1>Tour Stop 5: Akram's Shoppe</h1>
					<p>
						Akram’s Shoppe, named after the owner Akram, specialized in Middle-Eastern delicacies including their special falafel sandwich, chicken skewers, homemade hummus and baba ghanoush to name a few. Located at 191 Baldwin, it had a colourful display that added character to Kensington Market. Part self-serve cafeteria, part grocery store, it was a staple for students in the area. It was at an affordable price, with a healthy falafel costing only $2.99, and a complete meal for only $6. They even had some middle-easten groceries for sale at a lower cost than other bulk stores.
 						<br><br>
 						After being closed for renovations for 3 years from a tragedy of the store collapsing when trying to add a third floor, Akram’s Shoppe re-opened in 2010. It was open for over 20 years and officially shut down in 2017.

					<h1>Tour Stop 6: Zimmermans</h1>
					<p>
						Zimmerman’s discount store was owned and operated by Zoltan Zimmerman, who came to Canada in 1951 from Czechoslovakia. The Holocasut survivor came to Toronto after losing his parents in Auschwitz with promises to take care of his brothers and sisters. After 2 years living in Toronto, with the help of his brother and 2 two brother in-laws Zoltan started his business. Rows and rows filled with foods, vegetables, clothing, personal care products, household products and suitcases, the store was opened for more than 6 decades before its closure in 2015. 
						<br><br>
						When Zimmerman moves to Augusta Avenue to open his store his son recalls his dad working from 4am to 10 pm. His son had grown up to becoming part of his fathers team and working at Zimmerman’s discount store. 
						<br><br>
						The store started out as a victorian house that Zimmerman bought located on208 Augusta ave. Later on Zimmerman then bought the 2 houses on both sides of the first bought house making him owner of the houses 208, 210, and 212 Augusta Avenue. He combined the homes to create a bigger space which he turned into his store for he knew to be successful he had to work hard. 
						<br><br>
						His store became known to the locals and even people around the city, being the one stop shop of all your personal needs. The store became part of the neighbourhood and all that knew about the store were welcomed by the owner himself with great kindness. The store had done its most to grow with the times, as it was the convent place to buy before the convent Walmart, Costoco, and other common super-market franchises. With so much competition growing more and more Zimmerman decided to sell his store and said “all good things have to come to an end”. The store was later closed permanently in early January of 2015. With a heavy heart Zimmerman passed away at 93 years but was remembered as a hard worker who believed and said he loved his customers because, ”You learn a lot from your customers” he said.

					<h1>Tour Stop 7: Cosmic Treats</h1>
					<p>
						It is crazy to think an eatery spot like this one would close even with the high demand for vegan food options on the rise. A place like cosmic treats was known to be the place to come to enjoy the not so boring food with incredible flavour and the experience the neighbourhood reflected all at the same time. Kensington is filled with a unique atmosphere and to add such a creative eatery is what  contributes to the neighbourhoods environment, giving people the opportunity to try something new or something different. 
						<br><br>
						The owners named Tim Guimond and Elliot Alexander desired to create a menu that would sound appealing and loved the challenge to then deliver to the test buds while keeping the ingredients vegan friendly. They found their inspiration for foods through their travels around the world which drove them to their desire of opening a place for experimenting with vegan ingredients. Their goal became reality when they were pleased to get feed back that their vegan foods looked and tested delicious.
 						<br><br>
 						This place had brought everyone together to enjoy and learn how foods and flavours were created in other ways than the usual. Elliot and Tim loved sharing their ideas of vegan food options and expressed it through the most delicious looking foods you can place your eyes on. 
 						<br><br>
 						Unfortunately the property the eatery was located became newly leased and created a financial toll forcing Cosmic Treats to close down due to the enormous increase of rent that was tripled its original amount of $3000 to $9000 per month. The guys closed their business with a bang holding their last weekend's Pedestrian Sundays and the Veg Food Fest from September 6 to 8 before permanently closing Sunday, August 18, 2019.
